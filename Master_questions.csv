Given: the muscle inserts 0.07 m from the elbow axis and acts at 47 above horizontal. The forearm is 37 above horizontal and a 100 N weight acts 0.28 m from the elbow.,What is the value of $M_M$?,,,,,,,,,,22.2,22.6,"1. **First step in any static equilibrium question** Draw the free body diagram (FBD) about the elbow. 2. **Correct free body diagram** The correct diagram is **A**: * muscle force $F_M$ acts $0.07,\text{m}$ from the elbow, pulling up-and-left at $47^\circ$ above the horizontal, * the rope/weight force is $100,\text{N}$, acting at the hand, $0.28,\text{m}$ from the elbow, directed up-and-right at $37^\circ$ above the horizontal, * elbow has reactions $R_x, R_y$. 3. **Equations that apply** For a rigid body in the plane: $ \sum F_x = 0, \qquad \sum F_y = 0, \qquad \sum M_{\text{elbow}} = 0 $ We ll use the moment equation first so the unknown reactions drop out. 4. **Next step: write the moment equation about the elbow** * The muscle attaches $0.07,\text{m}$ *vertically* from the elbow. * Its line of action is $47^\circ$ above the horizontal, so it is $43^\circ$ from the vertical. * The moment of the muscle is therefore $ M_M = F_M (0.07)\sin 43^\circ $ * The weight force of $100,\text{N}$ acts $0.28,\text{m}$ *vertically* from the elbow, and the force is $37^\circ$ above the horizontal, i.e. $53^\circ$ from the vertical. Since $\sin 53^\circ = \cos 37^\circ$, its moment magnitude is $ M_W = 100(0.28)\cos 37^\circ $ Take counter-clockwise $+$ and set sum of moments to zero: $ F_M(0.07)\sin 43^\circ - 100(0.28)\cos 37^\circ = 0 $ 5. **Correct table** That s exactly what table **A** shows: $F_M(0.07)\sin 43^\circ$ for the muscle and $-100(0.28)\cos 37^\circ$ for the weight. 6. **Three conditions for static equilibrium** $ \sum F_x = 0, \qquad \sum F_y = 0, \qquad \sum M = 0 $ 7. **But we really want the *moment* made by the muscle** From the moment equation above, the muscle moment must balance the weight moment. So the muscle moment is just the weight moment: $ M_M = 100(0.28)\cos 37^\circ $ Now compute: $ \cos 37^\circ \approx 0.7986 $ $ 0.28 \times 0.7986 \approx 0.2236 $ $ M_M = 100 \times 0.2236 \approx 22.36 ,\text{N m} $ 8. **Final answer** $ \boxed{M_M \approx 2.24 \times 10^{1} \text{N m}} $",Images/SE_9.png,N.m,
